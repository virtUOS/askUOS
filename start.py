## Welcome to the Campus Management Chatbot.
### Our chatbot is designed to assist you with queries related to the University of Osnabrueck (e.g., applying or studying at the University).

- **This tool is a temporary test server meant for gathering feedback over a few days.**
- **It is intended for internal use only and not for public access.**
- With this test I am interested in finding out when the chat usually hallucinates and how often it hallucinates.
- I am also interested in getting a sense of how often the chatbot is able to provide the correct answer to the user's question.
Kindly note that any information you input or search for in the chat area is sent to OpenAI.
The Chatbot is powered by gpt-4o.

Have any question? Email me at yecanocastro@uos.de
