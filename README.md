## Overview

ask.UOS is designed to provide an interactive interface for users to communicate with a chatbot and access up-to-date university information. It leverages the `LangChain` library for natural language processing and `Streamlit` for the web interface. The system supports both German and English, and can be easily extended to other languages.

ask.UOS can answer a wide range of general questions about university life in just a few moments, including inquiries about the application process, academic requirements, and various study programs. The chatbot enables users to receive quick support in a conversational manner, without having to wait for office hours or search for the right contact personâ€”available 24/7. For university departments such as student advisory services, the chatbot also helps reduce the volume of support requests.

- Multilingual support (German and English)
- Customizable prompts and responses
- Vector database (Milvus) for efficient unstructured data retrieval

---

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- (For development) See `requirements.txt`
- (For production) See `requirements.prod.txt`

---

### Development with Docker

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-repo>
   ```

2. **Create and configure environment file**  
   ```sh
   cp .env.dev-example .env.dev
   # Edit .env.dev as needed
   ```

3. **Start the application**  
   ```sh
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. **Access the chatbot**  
   Open [http://localhost:8501/](http://localhost:8501/) in your browser.

**Note:** If you run the application without Docker, you must set up a Milvus server manually.

---

### Production with Docker

1. **Create and configure environment file**  
   ```sh
   cp .env.prod-example .env.prod
   # Edit .env.prod as needed
   ```

2. **Set up Nginx configuration (optional, for reverse proxy)**  
   ```sh
   cp ./nginx/nginx.conf.example nginx.conf
   # Edit nginx.conf as needed
   ```

3. **Start the application in production mode**  
   ```sh
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   ```

---

## Configuration

This application uses a configuration file (`config.yaml`) to manage its settings. The configuration is validated at startup using `Pydantic`, ensuring all required fields are present and correctly formatted.

- Modify the example file as needed for your environment.

  ```sh
   cp config_example.yamo config.yaml
   # Edit config.yaml as needed
   ```

---

## Milvus Vector DB

- A vector database (Milvus) is used for indexing and storage of unstructured data (e.g., pdf files).
- Milvus is automatically set up via Docker Compose and does not require manual installation.
- If you are already running a Milvus instance, you can connect ask.UOS with it. See `config_example.yaml`

---

## Translation Mechanism

ask.UOS supports both German and English, allowing users to switch languages seamlessly. The translation mechanism is implemented using Pythonâ€™s `gettext` library.

### How It Works

1. **Translation Setup**
   - The system generates a `base.mo` file from `locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/base.po` (automatically during Docker build).
   - The project sets up German translation using `gettext.translation` and provides a function for dynamic text translation.

2. **Language Initialization**
   - Streamlit presents a radio button for language selection (default: German).
   - The selected language is stored in the session state and query parameters.

3. **Usage in Streamlit**
   - Throughout the app, the translation function is used to display text in the userâ€™s chosen language.
